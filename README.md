# Password-Generator

## Description

This is a password generator made for the purpose of its namesake -- creating a password. This was made for the purpose of generating a strong, randomized password, which can be used to set up security for various technology platforms, be it accounts, files, etc. This password generator was crafted by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Too often, people create passwords that are not strong, possibly even containing guessable words that pertain to their personal information. This generator helps create a totally random password with personalized criteria to the user's liking. The randomness of the generator chooses from the capitalized alphabet, lowercased alphabet, numbers, and special keyboard characters of various punctuation. The generator pulls from these cateogories and shuffles the characters around to create a truly difficult password to crack, solving the problem of unsecure passwords.

In this challenge, I learned more about the syntax of JavaScript code, as well as how to utilize variables in a more meaningful way and how to concat and have those variables change throughout the page of code.
I also learned how to create and utilize alert, confirm, and prompt boxes, as well as how to keep them looping when sufficient criteria is not met.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
